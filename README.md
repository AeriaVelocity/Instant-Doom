# Instant Doom
A launcher for Doom designed to start your game as fast as possible. 
Currently only can launch Doom 1 or Doom 2, but can be configured to work with any source port.

## Using the launcher
### Adding your WADs
Next to the launcher executable (not your preferred source port) create a folder named `wads` if it does not already exist.<br>
(The bundled version will include this folder by default.)<br>
This folder is where you should put your `DOOM.WAD` and `DOOM2.WAD` files. (`DOOM1.WAD` also works)

### Playing the game
Open the launcher and select the game you want to play.<br>

#### Changing your source port
By default, the launcher is set to load Chocolate Doom. Click `Change source port` or hit the `C` key and enter the path to your desired source port to change this.

### Command line options
This program supports command line options. Click `Command line options` or hit the `E` key, then enter the command line options you wish to be applied.

### Chocolate/Crispy setup
If using Chocolate Doom or Crispy Doom (or any other source port with `<source port name>-setup.exe` next to it), click Setup or hit the `S` key to open its setup program.<br>
This button does nothing on other source ports.
